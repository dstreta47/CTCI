# Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome.
#  A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
# A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
# The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
# EXAMPLE
# Input: Tact Coa
# Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)

# Tact Coa
# O(n)
